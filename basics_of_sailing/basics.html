          <h3>Caps & Headwear</h3>
          They provide warmth and protection for your head and face.
          <br>This equipment is really important as it should both cover your face when necessary while providing a clear vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Gloves</h3>
          They protect your hands from rope burns and deformation caused by excessive use. Also provide warmth when needed.

          <h3>Boots</h3>
          Protects against slipping and tripping while providing warmth and flexibility.

          <h3>Bags & Luggage</h3>
          A neopren, hydrophobic and water resistant bag is necessary on a long journey. It's the housing of most of your items.

      <h1>Sailing Techniques</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Close Hauled</h3>
          This is defined as the closest to the wind we can efficiently sail and is usually a relative
          <br />bearing of 1 o'clock or 11 o'clock. On this point of sail the sails are brought in as close to
          <br />the centerline of the boat as possible. Here, we will be making small changes to our course to
          <br />fill the sails since we already have them trimmed in all the way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Close Reach</h3>
          The wind is coming from ahead of the boat with a relative bearing of 2 o'clock or 10 o'clock.
          <br />The fastest point of sail for most boats. Sail trim is critical for our boat speed. Telltales on
          <br />the sails will tell us how to trim. The basic idea is to let the sails out until they luff (flap)
          <br />then bring them in just to the point on no longer luffing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Beam Reach</h3>
          The wind is coming across the boat at a right angle to the centerline, the relative bearing would be
          <br />3 o'clock or 9 o'clock. In order to make the sails most efficient we adjust (trim) them for maximum
          <br />boat speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Broad Reach</h3>
          The wind is over one of our back shoulders or at a relative bearing of about 4 o'clock or 8 o'clock.
          <br />We may adjust the sails but sail trim is not critical. Just as in running above we probably won't
          <br />be able to let the mainsail out beyond just where it starts to touch the rigging
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Running</h3>
          This puts us directly downwind with the sails let out at right angles to the centerline of the boat.
          <br />The wind is at a relative bearing of 6 o'clock. We want to expose as much sail area as possible.
          <br />Sail trim is not critical, small adjustments don't make much difference in our boat speed.
          <br />Note: The standing rigging on most boats will not allow the mainsail to eased far enough out.
          <br />That's ok, let it out to the point just before the sail touches any rigging (so as to prevent chafe)
          <br />then tension the boom vang to bring the boom down.
