    <p style="font-size:20px;">
      While on a boat there are three main issues when treating a casualty
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One is lack of space, another is the potentially unstable environment (sailing in bad weather or rolling seas)
        <br />and the most poignant is the potentially long response time from medical professionals. Rather than getting an
        <br />emergency response team within 5 – 10 minutes, like we’re accustom to on land, we might have to wait hours, days
        <br />and in extreme cases, weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        On land, First Aiders often need to buy minutes to help save a life. Aboard a sailing vessel, the length of time
        <br />necessary to keep a casualty alive is most likely to be much longer. That being said, the First Aid course is much
        <br />more comprehensive than the typical course taught during land based courses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our excellent teacher, Sue Johnson, taught us about the standard First Aid components: CPR, choking, burns, fractures,
        <br />dealing with common health issues (heart problems, epilepsy, diabetics, allergies, stroke, etc.), bug and sea creature
        <br />bites/stings and much more. And she also related everything to the added complications of being on a boat.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stocking Onboard First Aid Kit</h2>
    <p>
      Most of your boating days are filled with carefree, good times. But occasionally you might have an injury onboard
      <br />– whether you cut your finger when slicing limes for a drink or you fall on a slippery deck. Suffering an injury on
      <br />the water is more serious than at home because you don’t have the luxury of your home medicine cabinet and you don’t
      <br />have quick access to emergency medical care. So it’s important to have a well-stocked onboard first aid kit to help
      <br />yourself or others. Here’s what you should have in your first aid kit.
