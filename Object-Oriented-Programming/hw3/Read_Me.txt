For some cases the program doesn't print out the output that Calico is expecting.
Instead it prints out what the homework asks for. Briefly explaining,
if there are not enough items in the stock to fullfil an order completely the program serves whatever is left in the stock.
For example if a customer orders 3 massala chickens and there are only enough ingredients to prepare 2 massala chickens,
the program does so and serves the dishes. As expected, it charges the customers as well.
In that case the program prints out:
>> We dont't have enough ingredients to make 3 massala chicken
>> Instead, we served 2.
Alternatively, if a custormer orders 4 cokes (a product that doesn't require ingredients to prepare) and there are only 2 cokes left in the stock,
the program serves the customer 2 cokes, charges them and then prints out:
>> Only 2 coke is left. I'll serve the remaining.
In other cases where there is not enough items to serve the ordered product, the program prints out the expected outcome of Calico.
